This repository is used for checking the distribution of phylogenetic contrasts that are used in the bootstrap procedure in the 
`l1ou` package. We found that for some nodes, the contrasts' mean was far away from zero. (Problem has been fixed)
We found the same variance for contrasts on all nodes, but with an unexpected value. The expected value should be sigma2. (Problem has not been saved)

Here is the summary of report I have worked on to find out the problem mentioned above.
