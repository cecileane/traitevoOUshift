# Project Title
The procedure for accurate bootstrap support that measures shifts on a phylogenetic tree   

# Overview of the research
I began conducting this research project in Biostatistics Department under the supervision of   
Professor Cecile Ane since Spring 2016.In this study, I focus on the methodology of the bootstrap  
procedure of shift detection on the phylogenetic (genealogical) tree which is a diagram showing   
the evolutionary relationships among different species. A shift indicates a place on the phylogenetic tree   
where dynamic diversification of morphological traits has occurred. Higher precision for detecting shifts   
is important because it points out the places where major morphological changes have happened on the tree.   
Furthermore, it helps biologists figure out the relations among certain species which are morphologically  
identical and explore how they evolved into their current status.  

I used R packages [`l1ou`](https://github.com/khabbazian/l1ou) and [`phylolm`](https://github.com/lamho86/phylolm) in this research project.
