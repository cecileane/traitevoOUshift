I found a bug in package `l1ou` version 1.27. There was a bug due to the function `normalized_tree`. For the tree has a root edge, the root edge was not used in the funtion. In addition, the distance from the root to all tips did not include the length of the root.edge. Due to this bug, the square root of the covariance matrix generated by the two models (OUrandomRoot and OUfixedRoot) are the same except for the last column which is the covariance of the root with other edges.

Now, the bug has been fixed and the square root of the covariance matrix generated by the two models are different.

I found a bug in package `l1ou` version 1.28.
Based on `l1ou` package version 1.28, there is still a potential problem in the package. 
We can see for covariance matrix generated by both models, their values do not match with `D{D^T}` and `B{B^T}`. So, there may be bug inside `sqrt_OU_covariance` for generating `D` and `B`. Furthermore, `B={{D^{-1}}^T}` has not been satisfied. 

Please look at the report for details:
